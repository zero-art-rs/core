# Abstract

**Asynchronous Ratchet Tree (ART)** is a novel cryptographic protocol designed to enhance the efficiency of group communications in centralized or decentralized settings. It introduces a mechanism for asynchronous updates to a ratchet tree structure, allowing for secure and scalable group messaging without the need for all participants to be online simultaneously. This protocol is particularly useful in scenarios where group members may join or leave at different times, ensuring that messages remain secure and accessible. **ART** is also adopted as a core part of the **Message Layer Security (MLS)** protocol which is used in various messaging applications (*Wire*, etc). One of the key features of **ART** is its ability to maintain forward secrecy, meaning that even if a group member's key is compromised, past messages remain secure. Unfortunatelly, the protocol is not designed to handle malicious group members trying to disrupt the group communication leading to a Sybil attacks in decentralized setting. Our contribution is a novel extension to the **ART** protocol that mitigates such attacks by using zero-knowledge proofs of group operations. This extension allows trustless group communication in decentralized or federated settings where every group member(possibly malicious) proves the correctness of **ART** updates. Also, our extension provides a mechanism for a group permission management without relying on a trusted party, enabling dynamic group membership changes while maintaining security and privacy.
